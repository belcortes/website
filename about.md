		<h4>A BIT ABOUT ME</h4>
		<p>I am originally from Brazil, though my childhood consisted of moving to a new country about every three years. I finally settled in NYC for college at Fordham University, where I completed a B.A. in Mathematics.</p>

		<p>My goal was to find a balance between Mathematics and Visual Arts, and I have found that in Web Development.</p>

		<p>I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at a startup (Appallicious) based in San Francisco. Although I have been working as a full-stack developer, front-end development is what I'm most excited about. I love transforming beautiful designs into user friendly applications and websites.</p>

    <h4>WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR</h4>
