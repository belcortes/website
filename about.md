			<h2><b>Hi!</b><br>
				I'm Isabel and I create websites and web apps for a living.<br>
				My background is in Mathematics and Visual Arts, which come in handy when coding.<br>
				I love to hike and rock climb in my free time.

			<!-- <h4>A bit about me</h4>
			<p>I am originally from Brazil, though my childhood consisted of moving to a new country about every three years. I finally settled in NYC for college at Fordham University, where I completed a B.A. in Mathematics.</p>

			<p>My goal was to find a balance between Mathematics and Visual Arts, and I have found that in Web Development.</p>

			<p>I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at a startup (Appallicious) based in San Francisco. Although I have been working as a full-stack developer, front-end development is what I'm most excited about. I love transforming beautiful designs into user friendly and immersive applications and websites.</p>

	    <h4>WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR</h4>
	    <p>I am looking for a developer position at a company that provides meaningful products and experiences for their clients to reach their maximum potential. I also want to be in a position that will allow me to grow as a professional and expand my technical skills.</p> -->
